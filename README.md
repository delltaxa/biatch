# biatch

bitach is an chatroom server written in python, which is really
easy to use and access!

biatch is protected with an password, which the admin can configure.
Almost all of the server logs will be written in the server terminal!

```
mkdir biatch
```

direct in to that directory

```
cd biatch/
```

```
git clone https://github.com/delltaxa/biatch
```

direct in to the new directory

```
cd biatch/
```

add permissions to execute biatch

```
chmod +x ./biatch
```

```
./biatch
```

oneliner

```

# Usage

if you cat the biatch file (not the python script)
you can see that it's running biatch.py with some configuration
you can change that configuration with what you like!
